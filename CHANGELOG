1.0.0 - 2017-08-07
------------------

This is first working prototype of the project. Let's call it a
proof-of-concept. It is basically playable even though it lacks major features
like sliders and scoring.

Here's what we got so far:

- Extremely basic gameplay.
- Overall support of most of the official beatmaps.
