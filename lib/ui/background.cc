 * we'll require ImageMagick anyway to generate thumbnails. Let's use that

/**
 * Downscale the background for the display, if necessary.

 * point to the new scaled surface.
 *
 * First, the resulting image size is computing using the same function as
 * #oshu_show_background. If the resulting size is smaller than the original
 * size, do nothing.
 *
 * Then, the image is converted to unpacked RGB: each pixel is made of 4-bytes,
 * one of which is unused. This format is called SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB888, or
 * CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24, but *not* SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB24. Cairo doesn't seem to
 * support packed 3-byte RGB.
 *
 * The destination SDL surface is created with the wanted size. Both surfaces
 * are then converted to cairo surfaces, without memory duplication because
 * that's how cairo integrates with SDL best. The source is painted on the
 * destination.
 *
 * Finally, everything is unlocked and freed except the destination surface,
 * which is stored in `*pic`. VoilÃ !
 *
 * It might sound a bit overkill to use cairo for that, but oshu! already
 * depends on it anyway, and the best SDL provides is SDL_BlitScaled, which
 * albeit fast, ruins the quality.
 *
 * \todo
 * Handle cairo errors.
