Contributing
============

Because the project is really young, please join the \#oshu IRC channel on
[chat.freenode.net](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat) if you'd like to
contribute. Someone is probably already working on your idea, and most likely
myself :)

You may also open issues on [GitHub][] or contact me directly by mail.

To generate the technical documentation of the game with Doxygen, you need to
cd to the `docs/` directory and run `make apidoc`. The documentation will be
accessible from `docs/html/index.html`. By the way, if you didn't have Doxygen
installed when you ran `./configure`, you'll need to call it again for it to
detect Doxygen.
