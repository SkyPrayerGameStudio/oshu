Changelog
=========

1.2.0 - ETA 2017-09-16
----------------------

Background pictures!

The overall graphics engine now uses more precise positions, yielding smoother
curves, and also uses a finer game clock, while ensuring a constant frame rate.

It's mostly a technical release though, with a more generic game module
refactored to support more game modes in the future. More refactoring to come
in the next release.

1.1.0 - 2017-09-02
------------------

Full slider support!

The game is now quite playable, and starts getting fun.

Extra features:

- Resizable window.
- Slightly nicer graphics, even though it's still wireframe.
- Dereference the symlinked beatmap files.
- Automatic pause when the window focus is lost.
- `--pause` option to start the game paused.
- Print a crude score on the terminal output at the end of songs.

1.0.0 - 2017-08-07
------------------

This is first working prototype of the project. Let's call it a
proof-of-concept. It is basically playable even though it lacks major features
like sliders and scoring.

Here's what we got so far:

- Extremely basic gameplay.
- Overall support of most of the official beatmaps.
