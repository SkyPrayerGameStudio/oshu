Changelog
=========

1.3.0 - 2017-10-14
------------------

Hit sounds!

While the hi-hat was a perfectly decent generic soft sound, exploiting the full
audio sample range gives a completely different experience. Now you'll hear
rythmic drums if you play well, and somethings other nice sound effects.

With this release comes a new parser, much more accurate than the previous one.
When a beatmap contains an error, the error is displayed and everyone is
invited to report them as oshu issues, because it's likely something is
missing.

The audio backend is also completely revamped to feature a flexible way to play
many sound effects at once. It should also be much more readable and organized.

1.2.0 - 2017-09-16
------------------

Background pictures!

The overall graphics engine now uses more precise positions, yielding smoother
curves, and also uses a finer game clock, while ensuring a constant frame rate.

It's mostly a technical release though, with a more generic game module
refactored to support more game modes in the future. More refactoring to come
in the next release.

1.1.0 - 2017-09-02
------------------

Full slider support!

The game is now quite playable, and starts getting fun.

Extra features:

- Resizable window.
- Slightly nicer graphics, even though it's still wireframe.
- Dereference the symlinked beatmap files.
- Automatic pause when the window focus is lost.
- `--pause` option to start the game paused.
- Print a crude score on the terminal output at the end of songs.

1.0.0 - 2017-08-07
------------------

This is first working prototype of the project. Let's call it a
proof-of-concept. It is basically playable even though it lacks major features
like sliders and scoring.

Here's what we got so far:

- Extremely basic gameplay.
- Overall support of most of the official beatmaps.
