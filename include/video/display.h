 * Abstract an SDL2 window.
 *
 * To avoid reinventing the wheel, this module provides only the most basic
 * functions for initializing the window and its renderer together, with the
 * appropriate settings.
 *
 * The main drawing operation on a display is #oshu_draw_texture. The other
 * drawing primitives must be called straight from SDL using the display's
 * underlying renderer. Note that while wrapped operations transform the
 * coordinates using the display's view, you would need to project the
 * coordinates yourself with #oshu_project to get a consistent behavior with
 * the equivalent SDL routines.
