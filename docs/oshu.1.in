.TH OSHU "1" "August 2017" "oshu! @VERSION@" "User Manual"

.SH NAME
oshu \- Lightweight port of the osu! rhythm game

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oshu
\fIBEATMAP\fR.osu

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Play a \fB.osu\fR beatmap file. Most linked files are automatically found from
the data inside the beatmap file.
.PP
On startup, oshu moves to the real directory of the beatmap, where it expects
to find the audio file. This lets you symlink your .osu files without bothering
with the related audio and picture files. In more technical terms, symbolic
terms are dereferenced.
.PP
\fB.osz\fR files are not supported, but since they're just fancy ZIP files, you
just have to unzip them into a sub-directory. Be careful though, it won't
create the sub-directory by itself if you naively unzip it.
.PP
A \fIhit.wav\fR file is required in order to play the sound effect when
clicking on a hit object. oshu! will first look into the current directory for
a file named like that. If it cannot find it, it will look into the default
data directory, configured at build time. By default,
\fI/usr/local/share/oshu/hit.wav\fR.
.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Increase the verbosity. This will print debugging messages, which may contain
useful information for understanding errors when fixing issues.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Show a brief help message.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-autoplay\fR
Perform a perfect run on the beatmap without any user interaction.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-pause\fR
Start the game in a paused state. Might be useful when you're starting the game
from a terminal as you won't be holding your mouse when the game starts.

.SH CONTROLS
.PP
The game is controlled from the keyboard and mouse. The keys are based on
osu!'s default settings.
.TP
\fBW, X, Z, mouse click\fR
Hit an object.
