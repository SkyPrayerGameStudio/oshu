 * drawing primitives must be called straight from SDL using the display's
 * underlying renderer. Note that while wrapped operations transform the
 * coordinates using the display's view, you would need to project the
 * coordinates yourself with #oshu::project to get a consistent behavior with
 * the equivalent SDL routines.
